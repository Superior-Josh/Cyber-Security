Exercises for learning Reverse Engineering and Exploitation.

All binaries for these challenges are ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64.

## reverse engineering

The goal is to run the chalenges like this `./rX password` and having them
print out `password OK`. It's reverse engineering, not cracking. So don't
patch the binnaries if you want to play by the rules. It gets really borring
if you don't anyway.
